**Quickstart**

1. Install Architect

```bash
npm install -g @architect/architect
```

2. Create a project folder

```bash
mkdir testapp
cd testapp
```

3. Run `arc init` to generate a basic project:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ http
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ get-index/index.js
â””â”€â”€ app.arc
```

4. Check out your first `app.arc` file & HTTP function!

```bash
# /project/path/app.arc
@app
your-app-name

@http
get /
```

```javascript
// src/http/get-index/index.js

exports.handler = async function http(request) {
  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'text/html; charset=utf-8;' },
    body: '<h1>Hello World! ðŸŽ‰</h1>'
  }
}
```
